# Fix-Joplin-Debian
Small script to fix Joplin in Debian due to permission problems with Electron/AppImage

Original procedure is from vsimkus, found here https://github.com/laurent22/joplin/issues/2246#issuecomment-577315584. I only put it into a single script for beginners or to allow automation.

Simply run the script from anywhere to fix the issue. Must have sudo rights. If your Joplin install is somewhere other than ~/.joplin, edit the script to reflect the change
